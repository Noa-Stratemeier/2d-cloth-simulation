PRIORITY:
- Add rebuild UI.


GENERAL:
- Test effect of enforcing compression constraints too.
- Remove points from 'points' array that aren't connected to any constraints.


CODE:
- Maybe add a default for parameters, so the program doesn't crash if no parameters are given.


PERFORMANCE:
- Maybe pass dt**2 into update position (this way it's only computed once).


NTH:
- Let points have masses (defaulted to 1).
